# Unemployement-Analysis
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at CodeAlpha.

The objective of this project is to analyze unemployment trends using Python. Data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis were performed to understand unemployment patterns across different regions and time periods. The project also highlights the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment rates.

Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used for data analysis and visualization.
